  description: "The Avian Passive Acoustic Monitoring System captures continuous environmental audio and processes it in three key stages: first, it detects segments containing bird vocalizations; next, it diarizes these segments to separate overlapping calls and track individual sources; finally, it classifies each diarized segment by species. This pipeline enables accurate, large-scale, and non-invasive monitoring of avian diversity and activity for ecological research and conservation.",
