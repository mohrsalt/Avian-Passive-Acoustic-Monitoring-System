  description: "The Avian Passive Acoustic Monitoring System captures continuous environmental audio and processes it in three key stages: first, it detects segments containing bird vocalizations; next, it diarizes these segments to separate overlapping calls and track individual sources; finally, it classifies each diarized segment by species. This pipeline enables accurate, large-scale, and non-invasive monitoring of avian diversity and activity for ecological research and conservation.",
  Introduction:
    "This project develops an edge ready acoustic system for continuous monitoring of bird populations. It records bird calls and songs, detects vocal activity, separates overlapping sources through diarization, and classifies each segment by species. The goal is to provide reliable, near real time insight into species presence and behavior while minimizing manual effort.",
